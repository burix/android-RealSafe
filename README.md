android-RealSafe
================

A android app for saving and encrypting images.

TODO (mandatory workpackages):

- encrypt/decrypt images
- save sent images as encrypted representation to file system
- create item structure and save/load structure to database
- last but least (actually of capital importance :D): 
	On each Activity resume show the password view where the
	user must enter the encryption password to protect all of these
	Real Safe secrets.
